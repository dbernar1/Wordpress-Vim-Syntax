Wordpress VIM Syntax Highlighting

For more information checkout my blog post here: http://www.kloppmagic.ca/blog/2011/05/wordpress-vim-syntax-highlighting/

Basically what you need to do is place the wordpress.vim in your .vim/syntax folder then when editing a wordpress php file run in your editor:

    :set syn=wordpress

Or simply setup in your vimrc file:

    autocmd BufEnter *.php :set syn=wordpress
